<h1>On-screen Keyboard Example</h1>
This is an on-screen keyboard that allows users to type letters and numbers into a text box. The keyboard is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h1>Installation</h1>
To use this keyboard, simply download the HTML file and open it in your web browser. There are no additional dependencies or installations required.

<h1>Usage</h1>
To use the keyboard, click on the individual keys to type letters and numbers into the text box. The text box is located at the center of the screen and can be scrolled through if the text extends beyond its boundaries. Once you have finished typing, click on the "Print" button to print out the text.

<h1>Styling</h1>
The keyboard is styled using CSS. The main container for the keyboard has a gray background color and a border, with a box-shadow effect to give it a 3D look. The keys are styled with a slightly darker border and a light green background color that changes to a darker green when pressed. Special keys, like the "Print" button, are styled differently to stand out from the other keys.

<h1>Functionality</h1>
The keyboard is created using JavaScript. Each key has an onclick event that calls a function to add the corresponding letter or number to the text box. The text box is a standard HTML textarea element with a maximum width of 800px and a border. The "Print" button calls a separate function that prints out the text in the text box.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
This on-screen keyboard is a simple example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create a functional user interface element. It can be easily customized to fit into any web application or website that requires text input.
